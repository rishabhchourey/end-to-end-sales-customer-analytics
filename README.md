#End-to-End Sales & Customer Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end Sales and Customer Analytics solution designed to analyze business performance using structured data. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the complete data analytics lifecycle, starting from raw data preparation to generating meaningful business insights through analysis and dashboards.

The project uses Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI to simulate a real-world data analyst workflow. Multiple datasets related to customers, orders, products, payments, and feedback were analyzed to understand sales trends, customer behavior, and payment performance.


## 🧩 Data Description
The dataset is organized into the following tables:

- **Customers**: Customer details such as name, age, city, and join date  
- **Orders**: Order-level data including product, quantity, price, and order date  
- **Products**: Product categories such as Food, Fitness, Electronics, and Services  
- **Payments**: Payment mode and payment status for each order  
- **Feedback**: Customer ratings and reviews for orders  


## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Excel** – Data preparation, formatting, and initial cleaning  
- **MySQL (SQL)** – Data storage, joins, aggregations, and analysis  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** – Exploratory data analysis and visualizations  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and business intelligence reporting  


## 📊 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation (Excel)
- Structured raw data into multiple tables for customers, orders, products, payments, and feedback  
- Performed basic data cleaning and formatting  
- Prepared data for import into MySQL  


### 2️⃣ Data Analysis using SQL (MySQL)
- Designed a relational database schema with multiple tables  
- Used SQL queries with JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and aggregate functions  
- Performed key analysis such as:
  - Total revenue calculation  
  - Monthly sales trend analysis  
  - Customer-wise revenue analysis  
  - Payment status analysis  


### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis using Python
- Loaded cleaned data into Python using Pandas  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
  - Total Revenue  
  - Total Orders  
  - Average Order Value  
- Created visualizations using Matplotlib including:
  - Line charts for monthly sales trends  
  - Bar charts for top customers  
  - Pie charts for payment status distribution  

---

### 4️⃣ Business Intelligence using Power BI
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize business performance  
- Created DAX measures for Total Revenue, Total Orders, and Average Order Value  
- Designed visuals such as:
  - Monthly Sales Trend  
  - Top Customers by Revenue  
  - Payment Status Analysis  
  - Orders by Gender and City  
- Added slicers for date and city to enable dynamic filtering  


## 📈 Key Insights
- Identified monthly sales trends and revenue fluctuations  
- Analyzed top-performing customers and cities  
- Evaluated payment success and failure rates  
- Gained insights into customer behavior and order patterns  


## 🎯 Conclusion
This project showcases practical experience in handling data end-to-end, from raw data to business insights. It reflects real-world data analytics tasks and demonstrates the ability to work with multiple tools to support data-driven decision-making.
